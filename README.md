**Intro**

This challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) and is coded by Reza Mohammadi, so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.
